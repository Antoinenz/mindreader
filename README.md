## TOS

by running mindreader.exe, you hereby agree to the following extremely serious and definitely legally binding terms:

- you will not use this software to read your teacher's mind during exams. unless it's really funny.
- if your computer starts levitating, that's normal. just let it vibe.
- we are not responsible if you accidentally unlock the secrets of the universe and/or summon a ghost.
- you must refer to the developer as “the all-knowing mind whisperer” at least once per usage.
- using this app on a toaster voids your warranty (and also the toaster might become sentient).
- if you think the software is spying on you... you're right. that's the whole point.
- don’t sue us. i'm just a dude with a laptop and a questionable  sleep schedule.
- by continuing, you accept that the voices you hear are not our fault. probably.
- refunds will be processed in imaginary currency only.
- side effects may include: enlightenment, confusion, laughter, and minor time travel.
